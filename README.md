I'm Thomas. I play guitar, run slowly, and use Oxford commas.🤓 Over the past six years I ran a [one man software studio](https://geeky.gent) successfully designing and developing software and [games](https://snip.rocks) for Apple's platforms. I'm passionate about software, music, food culture, writing, and teaching. _[I teach Git the practical way](https://git.coach)_. I'm currently located in Manitoba 🇨🇦 where I rediscovered my fascination for nature and photography.
