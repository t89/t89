### `printf("Hello, World!");`

I'm Thomas. I play guitar, run slowly, and use Oxford commas.🤓 I'm passionate about software, music, food culture, writing, and teaching. _[I teach Git the practical way](https://git.coach)_. Over the past seven years I ran a [one man software studio](https://geeky.gent) in Paderborn, Germany. I designed & developed software and [games](https://snip.rocks) for Apple's platforms. I'm currently located in Manitoba where I discovered my fascination for nature, archery, and craft-brewing 🍻.
