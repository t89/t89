### Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Thomas. I play guitar, run slowly, and use oxford-commas.🤓 Over the past six years I ran a [one man software studio](https://geeky.gent) successfully designing and developing software and [games](https://snip.rocks) for Apple's platforms. I'm passionate about software, music, food culture, writing, and teaching. _[I teach Git the practical way](https://git.coach)_. I'm currently located in 🇨🇦 Manitoba where I rediscovered my fascination for nature and photography.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust and most likely some [Mateus Asato tune 🎸](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWazjfBJv-s)
